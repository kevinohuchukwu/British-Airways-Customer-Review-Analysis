The tool requires the following Python libraries:
*	pandas: Data manipulation and analysis (1.1.0 or greater).
*	numpy: Numerical computing (1.19.0 or greater).
*	matplotlib: Visualization (3.3.0 or greater).
*	seaborn: Statistical data visualization (0.11.0 or greater).
*	nltk: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing (3.5 or greater). 
*	nltk.corpus: Provides access to stopword datasets.
*	nltk.tokenize: Tokenization of text.
*	nltk.stem: Lemmatization for stemming words to their base form.
*	wordcloud: Generates word clouds for text visualization (1.8.0 or greater).
*	BeautifulSoup (from bs4): HTML and XML parsing for web scraping (4.9.0 or greater).
*	requests: HTTP library for making web requests (2.25.0 or greater).
*	datetime: Handles date and time objects (built-in with Python 3.x).
*	time: Provides time-related functions (built-in with Python 3.x).
*	string: Contains string constants and functions (built-in with Python 3.x).
*	re: Regular expression operations (built-in with Python 3.x).
*	IPython.display: For interactive widgets and display in Jupyter Notebooks.

### Additional Notes:
*	nltk requires downloading specific datasets (e.g., stopwords, WordNet) using nltk.download().
*	BeautifulSoup is used for web scraping, and requests provides the interface to fetch web pages.
*	Visualization is supported by matplotlib, seaborn, and wordcloud.

# Understanding The Data
## Python Usage

You can fetch data from the British Airways reviews page using the following Python code:

```python
url = "https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways"
HEADERS = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/123.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
response.raise_for_status()
print(response.text)

```bash
python script.py

### This script is a basic web scraping setup that retrieves and prints the raw HTML of the specified webpage. Itâ€™s the first step in processing the page, which could involve further parsing or analysis using libraries like BeautifulSoup.
