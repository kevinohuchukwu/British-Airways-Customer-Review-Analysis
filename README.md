# British Airways Customer Review Analysis
## Objective
Analyze customer reviews to identify key drivers of passenger satisfaction and areas for improvement.
## Key Insights
*	Passenger Concerns: Frequent mentions of seating arrangements, class types, food quality, delays, and service management.
###	Prerequisites
The tool requires the following Python libraries:
*	pandas: Data manipulation and analysis (1.1.0 or greater).
*	numpy: Numerical computing (1.19.0 or greater).
*	matplotlib: Visualization (3.3.0 or greater).
*	seaborn: Statistical data visualization (0.11.0 or greater).
*	nltk: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing (3.5 or greater). 
*	nltk.corpus: Provides access to stopword datasets.
*	nltk.tokenize: Tokenization of text.
*	nltk.stem: Lemmatization for stemming words to their base form.
*	wordcloud: Generates word clouds for text visualization (1.8.0 or greater).
*	BeautifulSoup (from bs4): HTML and XML parsing for web scraping (4.9.0 or greater).
*	requests: HTTP library for making web requests (2.25.0 or greater).
*	datetime: Handles date and time objects (built-in with Python 3.x).
*	time: Provides time-related functions (built-in with Python 3.x).
*	string: Contains string constants and functions (built-in with Python 3.x).
*	re: Regular expression operations (built-in with Python 3.x).
*	IPython.display: For interactive widgets and display in Jupyter Notebooks.

### Additional Notes:
*	nltk requires downloading specific datasets (e.g., stopwords, WordNet) using nltk.download().
*	BeautifulSoup is used for web scraping, and requests provides the interface to fetch web pages.
*	Visualization is supported by matplotlib, seaborn, and wordcloud.
  
# Understanding The Data

[import requests.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18136705/import.requests.docx)

This script is a basic web scraping setup that retrieves and prints the raw HTML of the specified webpage. Itâ€™s the first step in processing the page, which could involve further parsing or analysis using libraries like BeautifulSoup

[Load the dataset.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18136779/Load.the.dataset.docx)

The script processes a dataset of reviews, performing text cleaning and saving the cleaned data for further analysis. Here's a brief explanation:
1.	Load Dataset: The dataset (BA_reviews.csv) is loaded into a DataFrame with two columns: Review and Date.
2.	Text Cleaning Function:
*	Removes unwanted parts of the text ('Not Verified |').
*	Converts text to lowercase for uniformity.
*	Strips punctuation using str.translate.
*	Tokenizes text into words using word_tokenize.
*	Removes common stopwords (like "the", "and") using the stopwords list from NLTK.
*	Applies lemmatization to convert words to their base form using WordNetLemmatizer.
3.	Apply Cleaning: The clean_text function is applied to each review in the Review column, creating a new column cleaned_review.
4.	Drop Original Column: The original Review column is dropped as the cleaned version replaces it.
5.	Save Cleaned Data: The cleaned data, including the cleaned_review and Date columns, is displayed and optionally saved to a new CSV file (cleaned_reviews.csv) for further use.
 	
## Purpose
This script ensures the review text is standardized and simplified for text analysis tasks like sentiment analysis or NLP modeling.
